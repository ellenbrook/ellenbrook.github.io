<p>Prior to working with The Detroit Cast, their traffic was dismal. Their website served a purpose but it didn't do it as efficiently as it could. Their Podcast is popular but because Podcasting is such a new technology, making money in the field can be quite difficult. I worked with Mike and Jay from The Detroit Cast in order to create a product that they're not only proud of, but a product that they're proud of <em>and</em> makes them money.</p> 

<p>According to the traffic statistics, The Detroit Cast's website was on a slow decline from the month of September of 2014 (Average 1,300 visitors per day), to April of 2015 (Average 1,007 visitors per day). Upon launching the website, traffic increased to 1,239 visitors per day in May and 1,352 visitors per day in June with only signs growth for the future. Furthermore, I worked with the team in order to help generate revenue from the website. Although the amount cannot be disclosed, it's safe to say that the growth has been exponential and that can only lead to growth with the show and the Radio For One Studios Podcast network.</p>

<p>I continue to work with Mike and Jay and I'm proud of the work we've accomplished. If you're in the Detroit area and you're lacking a morning time radio show with no FCC regulations, then I urge you to check out <a href="http://thedetroitcast.com">The Detroit Cast</a></p>

<p>For a taste as to what they think about working with me, I refer you to the following video. Please be aware that this is NSFW due to extreme language. </p>
