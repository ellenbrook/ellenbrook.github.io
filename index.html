<p>Hi. I'm Eric Ellenbrook and, as the title says, I create websites for people like you. Especially if you're a studio in or around the Detroit area that is looking for a new addition to their team.</p>

			<a href="/jquery-scroll-distance-detection/" data-no-instant>jQuery Scroll Distance Detection</a>
			<p>This plugin keeps track of the distance a user has scrolled in a document and allows you to slide in, fade in, and pop up some sort of HTML element. It's useful for "Back to top" links, social media slide in containers for blog posts, and more.</p>

			<a href="/wikihover-google-chrome-extension/">WikiHover Chrome Extension</a>
			<p>WikiHover is a Chrome extension that removes all of the hassle from reading Wikipedia articles. Instead of being lost in a sea of tabs of pages and terms you don't quite understand, you can simply hover over the link and read a brief description of the article.</p>

<h3>My non-developer life</h3>
<p>When I'm away from the computer, the thing that I enjoy the most is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I am a blue belt and I've been training for over two years. In that time I've dropped 40 pounds, gained a lot of confidence, and learned the hard work that it takes to succeed.</p>
